function CC = freemancc(B)
%FREEMANCC Compute Freeman chain code, first difference of the chain code
%and shape number of a boundary or contour.
%   CC = FREEMANCC(B) computes the 8-connected Freeman code, the first
%   difference of the chain code and also the shape number for a given
%   boundary or contour B. B must be a P-by-2 matrix, where P is the number
%   of 8-connected boundary pixels for the corresponding region. Each row
%   of B represents the row and column coordinates for a pixel. CC is a
%   structure with four fields:
%
%       StartIdx    Row and column coordinates for the starting pixel of
%                   the boundary B.
%
%       ChainCode   The 8-connected chain code of B. If B is a P-by-2 
%                   matrix of pixels representing a closed contour, then
%                   size of this array is 1-by-(P-1). If B is an open
%                   contour, then size of the chain code is 1-by-P.
%
%       FirstDiff   The first difference of the chain code, representing 
%                   its rotation-invariant equivalent form and having the 
%                   same dimensions as the chain code.
%
%       ShapeNum    The shape number of the boundary, which is the first
%                   difference of the smallest magnitude.
%
%   The transition from current pixel coordinates to the next is computed
%   from the connectivity diagram and tables shown below
